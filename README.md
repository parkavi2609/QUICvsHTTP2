# QUICvsHTTP2
Increase in size and complexity of web pages has challenged the efficiency of HTTP.
Recent enhancements made to speed up the web have resulted in QUIC. This project mainly focuses on measuring the performance of websites hosted on HTTP/2 and QUIC protocol in emulated controlled network conditions. Our approach is to sweep the parameter space and evaluate where QUIC currently helps or hurts. This has helped in concluding that though HTTP/2 outperforms QUIC in most scenarios, QUIC offers significant advantage in low bandwidth and high latency links.
